## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learned a lot when it came to the javascript section and am very proud of it as I figured out 95% of it by myself and Googled the other 5%. The javascript in the code snippet was particularly challenging and could probably be refactored to be shortened but I don't have those skills yet...

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
tipAmount.textContent = `$${tipPerPerson.toFixed(2) ? tipPerPerson.toFixed(2) : ".00"}`;
totalAmount.textContent = `$${(totalPerPerson + tipPerPerson).toFixed(2)}`;
```

### Continued development

I am keen to keep learning javascript and improving my skills. I am busy with a great javascript course at the moment by Jonas Schmedtmann, I still have a long way to go but I am happy with my progress so far.

### Useful resources

- [Current javascript course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) - I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn javascript...
